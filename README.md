# Tropadom
Go from campfires eating your hunted chicken to creating a house filled with pistons, doors, and ladders while your industrial machinery refines your ore.  Craft, conquer, and explore this 1000x150 Minecraft-inspired world with 4 biomes with 3 weather patterns in my 2014 personal project: Tropadom.
